# SummitAi

**SummitAi** is a web application designed to help users organize and generate concise summaries of their meetings. Users can upload a PDF or paste raw transcript text, which is processed and structured into a summary with clear sections: **Title**, **Summary**, **Questions**, **Decisions**, **Actions**, and **Tags**.

Each meeting gets its own dedicated page. All meetings are accessible from a personalized **dashboard**, which supports **client-side substring searching** and **tag-based filtering** to quickly find relevant summaries. Meetings can be modified on its meeting page to add / remove content.

This project introduced me to:

* **Openrouter api calling & structured prompt design**
* **Dynamic client-side filtering and search**
* **Text-to-structured-data workflows using LLMs**

It also builds on prior experience with:

* **Next.js** & **React**
* **TailwindCSS**
* **shadcn/ui**
* **better-auth** (email + OAuth)
* **Zod** for schema validation
* **Prisma ORM** with **PostgreSQL**
* **React Query**
* **Nodemailer**
* **Vercel** deployment

## Folder Structure

```
/app                # Next.js app directory
/actions            # Auth + nodemailer api actions
/components         # Shared UI components
/app/api            # API routes (auth, summarization, meetings)
/lib                # Utility functions (auth, openrouter. prisma, nodemailer)
/hooks              # Hooks for api calling using react query
./prisma            # Prisma schema and migrations
/types              # Shared TypeScript types

## Challenges Faced

* **Structured outputs from Mistral via OpenRouter** â€” crafting prompts to return consistent JSON from Mistral required fine-tuning, especially on longer or messy transcripts.
* **Dashboard filtering** â€” building performant client-side filtering for both text and tags.
* **Handling unstructured input** â€” ensuring robustness when users upload poor-quality PDFs or poorly formatted text.

---

## Future Improvements

* Support multiple file types (e.g. `.docx`, `.txt`)
* Add tag suggestions based on content
* Export summaries to PDF or markdown
* Add role-based access or teams
* Test coverage (unit & integration tests)

## Conclusion

SummitAi was a deep dive into structured AI outputs, fullstack development, and user-centered UX. It combines LLM-powered processing with practical user tools, all built on a modern web stack. It taught me valuable lessons about handling dynamic, unstructured data and turning it into usable knowledge for users.
